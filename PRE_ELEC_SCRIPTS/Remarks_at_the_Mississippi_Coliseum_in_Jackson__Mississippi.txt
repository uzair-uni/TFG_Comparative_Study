Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much. [applause]
Senator, Governor and Rudy, thank you very much.
Wow, what a group! What a group!
Very excited, very, very excited to be with you tonight. Thank you very much. [applause]
The people of Jackson and the state of Mississippi have such incredible energy, that very powerful word "energy," unbelievable, incredible energy and spirit, folks. Thank you very much.
And thank you for all the support you've given me right from the beginning. I will not forget it, Mississippi. We love Mississippi right from the beginning, right from the beginning. [applause]
This is the spirit we need to rebuild our country a hundred percent. [applause]
And this is our chance to break free from the bitter failures of the past and to create a new American future. [applause]
To everyone watching across our nation right now, to everyone who has been let down by our terrible, terrible politicians, I am asking for your vote on November 8th. [applause]
This is your chance to remove the special interests from their throne of power and to once again have a government of, by and for the people. [applause]
No one will be left behind anymore. [applause]
I'd like to take this moment to send our thoughts and prayers to everyone at the American University in Kabul, Afghanistan. They are going through a lot.
We must defeat radical Islamic terrorism! [applause]
Anyone who will not name our enemy is not fit to lead our country. [applause]
Eight years of Obama/Clinton policies have sacrificed our safety and undermined our freedom and independence. Our jobs have moved to other countries. Islamic terrorism has spread within our shores. And an open border has crushed low-income workers and threatened, and I mean totally threatened, our security. [applause]
The issues we face here in America are similar to the issues faced in Britain during their referendum on membership in the European Union. This is the movement known as Brexit.
On June 23rd, the people of Britain voted to declare their independence, which is what we're looking to do also, folks [applause]
From their international government which hasn't worked. They voted to break away from rule by large corporations and media executives who believe in a world without borders. [booing]
They voted to reclaim control over immigration, over their economy, over their government. [booing]
Working people and the great people of the U.K. took control of their destiny. [applause]
The people profiting from the rigged system, and it is rigged, we're finding it out every single day, the multinational banks, the media celebrities, the big donors tried to scare the British people out of voting for change. The same thing is happening right here in the United States. It's happening.
All the people benefiting from our rigged system don't want things to change. They want you to believe things can't be changed.
And they can so easily, so easily and so smartly.
And we all know things have to change. We have no choice. And they have to change right now. [applause]
Before the vote, I said that Britain would leave the EU, sometimes referred to as European Union, and I said it and I took a lot of heat when I said it. People said, what does he know, what does he know? And guess what? I was very supportive of their right to do it and to take control of their own future, like exactly what we're going to be voting for on November 8th. [applause]
Hillary Clinton, who has been on the wrong side of history in every major decision, she's only made bad decisions, she's got bad judgment, she doesn't know what she's doing, folks. [booing]
She got this one wrong, too.
She got this one wrong, too, folks. She got this one wrong, too. She gets them all wrong. She gets them all wrong, doesn't she? She really got the e-mails wrong, that I can tell you. [laughter]
And now Hillary wants to surrender America to globalism, just what we don't want. [booing]
She wants a country without borders. She wants trade deals written for the benefit of foreign corporations. She wants a government that ignores the will of the people. [booing]
She wants to sell out American security to the Clinton Foundation for a big, fat pile of cash. [booing]
It's hard to tell where the Clinton Foundation ends and where the State Department begins.
According to the Associated Press, more than half the meetings she took as secretary of state with people outside government were with foundation donors. [booing]
Hillary Clinton does not believe in America first. We believe in America first. [applause]
Hillary believes in donors first and special interests and lobbyists. She will never straighten out our country. She doesn't have the strength, the stamina or the ability to straighten out our country. We'll have four more years of Obama and that's just what we don't want. [booing]
She would rather give a job to a refugee from overseas than an unemployed American veteran or to an unemployed African American or Hispanic. [booing]
The job of a public official is to serve and protect the citizens of the United States [applause]
Not illegal immigrants, not foreign nationals seeking entry, but the people living here lawfully today, including millions of African-American and Hispanic citizens, millions, millions being treated very, very unfairly, I can tell you that.
My focus will always be on the well-being of more than 300 million American citizens who call this country home and who love their country. [applause]
I will fight for their security. I will fight for their jobs. We will not let jobs be taken out of our country, be ripped out of our country and moved to Mexico and many other countries. We will not let it happen anymore. [applause]
We'll be fighting for their jobs and we'll be fighting for your families, that I can tell you. It ends. What's been going on ends on November 8th. [applause]
We will have one American nation, not divided, we will be together. Hillary Clinton has betrayed her duty to the people. November 8th is our chance to re-declare American independence. [applause]
This is a great honor for me. I am going right now to invite onto the stage the man behind Brexit and a man who led brilliantly the United Kingdom Independence Party in this fight and won despite all odds, despite horrible name-calling, despite so many obstacles.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Nigel Farage. [applause]
